# Thermal
Python Heating Control System for Raspberry Pi

A domestic heating control system with infinate number of on/off cycles per day,
planned implamentation of temperature data-logging and output info to 1.8" Sainsmart tft display.

output of graph, internal vs external temperature & heating on / off times will enable visual display of house thermal efficiency.
